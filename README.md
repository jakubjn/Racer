# Racer

A Caido Plugin for finding Race Conditions with the Single Packet Attack. Essentially a wrapper around the 'h2spacex' library in Python.

## Usage

The plugin can be used from the HTTP History ONLY. The requests must be sent from the replay tab and then found in the HTTP History to race them.
